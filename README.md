## Projects

### Home Network Lab

#### Objective

- previous system was typical 19" server racks, which were too big and bulky for basic homelab needs
- power system needs to modular: all systems should take in DC power supplies inputs instead of AC-to-DC converters
- common power supplies with same voltage need to be unified to reduce number of total AC outlets
- power supplies should have uninterrupted power supplies

#### Solution

- systems sold include 4U server chasis, Uinterrupted Power Supplies

#### Current
